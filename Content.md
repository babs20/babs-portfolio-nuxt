### Project Short Description
Developed new Church Streaming License feature, incl. new product page, Planning Center integration, updates to existing features.

### Project Long Description
As a front-end developer, I was responsible for the development and implementation of the Church Streaming License feature on our website. This feature required creating a new product page that provided detailed information about the license and its benefits. Additionally, I integrated a third-party solution, Planning Center, to allow users to import their setlists into our ecosystem, improving the user experience by streamlining the process.

I also made various updates and changes to existing features and products in order to improve their performance and user experience. For instance, I optimized the product pages for mobile devices to ensure that users can access the information they need regardless of the device they are using.

This feature represented a significant update to the website and I am proud of my contribution in its development. I believe this project showcases my ability to work on creating new product pages, integrating third-party solutions and making updates to existing features and products.
